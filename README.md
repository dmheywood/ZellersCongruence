Zeller's Congruence in C#

Recently trained none traditional student with an A.S. in Computer Science.

This was a program I created in my Programming in C++ class. I wanted to learn C# so I have started writing all of my old C++ and Java project in C#.

This project is the first one I have tried. More to come shortly.
